# Swagger Implementation Info (using Springfox libraries)

The whole idea is to create API reference documentation for a RESTFul service that serves the JSON/XML data through end points. Swagger does the job and the same is implemented using the springfox libraries. This totally cuts down the need for creating a Restful client and a seperate documentation. 2 in 1. This is a very simple RESTful project ( Gradle ) created using spring.io
